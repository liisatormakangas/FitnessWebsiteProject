The task was to implement a web app/site based on the chosen topic and to include certain functionalities such as register, login, editing data, and commenting. Implementation should be done using TypeScript, NodeJS, Express and PostgreSQL.

The web site includes fitness-related blog texts that users can read and comment, a web shop to buy courses related to fitness and wellness, body mass index and calorie calculators, and short stories about successful user experiences.
